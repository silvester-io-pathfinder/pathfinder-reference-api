Instead, travelers much perform complex and difficult rituals described within the pages of such monstrously rare tomes as the Necronomicon and the Book of Serpents, Ash, and Acorns: Shadows of What Was and Will Be. Compounding the plane’s obscurity, each traveler’s experience seems to be unique, and most who attempt the journey never return. Every manner of magic that interacts with the plane invariably draws the attention of creatures such as the hounds of Tindalos. The proper flow and continuity of time seems to self-correct for any attempted meddling, often with violence." };

Travelers appear as transparent images of themselves, but the plane seems averse to any attempt to alter the past, no matter the means or the intention.
