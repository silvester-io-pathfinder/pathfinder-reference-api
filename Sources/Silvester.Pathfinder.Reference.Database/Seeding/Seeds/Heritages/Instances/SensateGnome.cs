You gain a special sense: imprecise scent with a range of 30 feet. This means you can use your sense of smell to determine the exact location of a creature. The GM will usually double the range if you're downwind from the creature or halve the range if you're upwind. In addition, you gain a + 2 circumstance bonus to Perception checks whenever you're trying to locate an undetected creature that is within the range of your scent."
