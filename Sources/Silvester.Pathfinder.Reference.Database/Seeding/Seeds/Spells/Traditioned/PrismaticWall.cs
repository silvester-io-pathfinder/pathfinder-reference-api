The wall is straight and vertical, stretching 60 feet long and 30 feet high.

The wall sheds bright light out to 20 feet on each side (and dim light to the next 20 feet). Creatures other than you that come into the wall’s light must attempt a Will save; they’re dazzled for 1 round on a success, blinded for 1 round on a failure, and blinded for 1 minute on a critical failure.

A creature that tries to pass through the wall must attempt a saving throw against each component wall.

Counteracting a color wall removes that color’s effect from the wall, and counteracting them all ends prismatic wall. You can Dismiss the spell." };
