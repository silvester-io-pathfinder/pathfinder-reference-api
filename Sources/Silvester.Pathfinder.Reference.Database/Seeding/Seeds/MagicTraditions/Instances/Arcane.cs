Because of its far-reaching approach, the arcane tradition has the broadest spell list, though itâ€™s generally poor at affecting the spirit or the soul. Wizards are the most iconic arcane spellcasters, poring over tomes and grimoires, though arcane sorcerers study the secrets of their blood to unlock the power within themselves."
