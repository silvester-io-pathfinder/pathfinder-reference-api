If you have conflicting conditions that affect your number of actions, you choose which actions you lose. For instance, the action gained from haste lets you only Stride or Strike, so if you need to lose one action because you’re also slowed, you might decide to lose the action from haste, letting you keep your other actions that can be used more flexibly." };

Other conditions simply say you can’t act. When you can’t act, you’re unable to take any actions at all.

That means if you are somehow cured of paralysis on your turn, you can act immediately." };
