Anyone except the chosen creature can cross the circle without trouble, but the chosen creature must attempt a Will save against your class DC whenever it attempts to do so. On a failure, the chosen creature remains on the same side of the circle and the action it was using to attempt to cross the circle is disrupted. Creatures other than the chosen creature can spend a total of three (action: Interact) actions scuffing the circle to break the effect early. These actions don't need to be consecutive." };
