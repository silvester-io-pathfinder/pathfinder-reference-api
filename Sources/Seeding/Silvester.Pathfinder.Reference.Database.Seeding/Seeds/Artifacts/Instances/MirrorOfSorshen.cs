The specific image varies depending on the observer, even when more than one creature is looking into the mirror at the same time. Observers are fascinated by the images in the mirror unless they succeed at a DC 35 Will save each round. On a failure, they stare blankly at the mirror for as long as it remains in view, and if it leaves their view, they stare toward the last place they saw the mirror for several minutes thereafter. This is an emotion, enchantment, incapacitation, and visual effect. Creatures that are fascinated by the mirror are so deeply entranced that they don’t end their fascinated condition automatically even if a creature uses hostile actions against them or their allies; instead, they can attempt a DC 30 Will save to end the fascination. At the GM’s discretion, a truly innocent creature or a creature that has renounced all worldly pleasures might be immune to the mirror’s fascination." };
