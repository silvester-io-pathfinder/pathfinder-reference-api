Your obviously fiendish traits disappear, including any tails, horns, and cloven hooves, though hints remain (claws turn into jagged nails or eyes retain an odd hue, for instance). You're still recognizably yourself, but now appear as a typical, non-tiefling member of your base ancestry. Using Devil in Plain Sight counts as creating a disguise when using Deception to {ToMarkdownLink<Models.Entities.SkillAction>("Impersonate", SkillActions.Instances.Impersonate.ID)}, and your transformation automatically defeats Perception DCs to determine if you're a normal member of your base ancestry; only creatures actively rolling Perception to examine you might notice the disguise. While in your shapeshifted form, you can't use unarmed attacks, innate spells, or other abilities that require physical features you receive from a tiefling ancestry featâ€”for instance, you can't use the {ToMarkdownLink<Models.Entities.Feat>("Skillful Tail", Feats.Instances.SkillfulTail.ID)} feat. You can remain in your alternate form indefinitely, and can shift back to your tiefling form by using this action again." };
