When you cast an {ToMarkdownLink<Models.Entities.Trait>("enchantment", Traits.Instances.Enchantment.ID)} spell that targets only one creature within 30 feet who can see you, you can gaze into the creature's eyes, causing the creature to take a â€“1 status penalty to their saving throw against your spell unless they choose to break the eye contact as a reaction. If they don't look away, you're fascinated with them until the end of your next turn as you maintain the eye contact. When you use Mesmerizing Gaze, the {ToMarkdownLink<Models.Entities.Action>("Avert Gaze", Actions.Instances.AvertGaze.ID)} action provides its bonus to saving throws against your spell, as the spell's effects have become connected to the eye contact." };
