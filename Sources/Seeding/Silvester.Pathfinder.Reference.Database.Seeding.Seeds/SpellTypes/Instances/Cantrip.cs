               Description = "A cantrip is a special type of spell that's weaker than other spells but can be used with greater freedom and flexibility. The title of a cantrip's stat block says “Cantrip” instead of “Spell.” Casting a cantrip doesn't use up your spell slots; you can cast a cantrip at will, any number of times per day. If you're a prepared caster, you can prepare a specific number of cantrips each day. You can't prepare a cantrip in a spell slot. A cantrip is always automatically heightened to half your level, rounded up. For a typical spellcaster, this means its level is equal to the highest level of spell slot you have."
